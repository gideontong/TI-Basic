For clarification,  is a -> or the arrow in TI calculators, commonly seen as Store, STORE>, STO>, etc. Also, ² is ^2 or squared symbol. Also, √ is the square root symbol.

All program names are the same 8-letter long names from my original TI-85 calculator, which is 8-bit. Therefore, some names may seem like spelling errors, but I only can fit 8 letters!

I have yet to put something here, but the point of this folder is to store TI-BASIC programs written for the TI-85.

Things to do: upload RtTriRto, and update RtTriRto so it also has tan().
