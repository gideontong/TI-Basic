TI Calculator Toolkit
========

This is a repository code and programs for Texas Instruments calculators, all of which are written by Gideon Tong.

Feel free to shoot me an email listed at my GitHub user page or at Gideon Tong <gideon@gideontong.com>. Thanks! I formerly had access to a TI-85 and a TI-89 Titanium, but since I have no longer access to these calculators, I am no longer developing for these calculators. My current graphing calculator is the TI-84+ CE, which has proved to be a very capable calculator on its own.
