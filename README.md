TI-Tools
========

This is a repository containing TI-BASIC code written by Gideon Tong. Feel free to shoot me an email, however since I'm not maintaining old code (I wrote these programs for classes, essentially one-time use programs that I'll never use again). In addition, I don't use the TI-85 or the TI-89 Titanium anymore as the TI-84 has become the gold standard for calculators in classrooms, even though the TI-89 Titanium is super powerful with its built-in CAS.
