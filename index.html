<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-ti-tools" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to TI-tools.</h3>

<p>This page is a quick place to download all the TI-BASIC tools I've written for the calculator over the years. It is not regularly maintained or updated but merge requests are by all means encouraged. Sometimes I do forget to upload new programs I've written but usually you'll find them sometime before or after a test in math or science classes.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#supported-calculators" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Supported Calculators</h3>

<p>As I've progressed through using friends' calculators and through several of my own calculators, the calculators these programs are for will tend to change. These programs are categorized by the calculator it was written for, but it is completely possible to use them on any compatible calculator. Currently the only calculator I support is the TI-84 Plus CE.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#adding-programs-yourself" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adding programs yourself</h3>

<p>It is quite simple to add a program yourself, simply drag and drop it into the corresponding TI Connect software for your calculator. If you would like to contribute to this repository, email me at the bottom of the page (I will give you credit) and I can add your program. In addition, you can clone the <code>main</code> branch and merge with it later.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Gideon Tong (<a href="https://github.com/gideontong" class="user-mention">@gideontong</a>) is currently the sole maintainer and contributer to the TI Tools repository. Programs may have been based on other programs but all source code is original. Since 2014, several programs have been written in order to help people get those A's on their tests.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble using these programs on your calculator and your relentless Google searches do not turn up with anything, or you are unable to enable these programs on your calculator, feel free to shoot me an email at gideontong@splimtech.com!</p>
